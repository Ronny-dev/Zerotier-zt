# Zerotier-zt

This repository is a simple demo of Zerotier, compiled with the libzt library.

Although we can see some sources on GitHub through which we can get the source code, Zerotier has not officially open sourced their Android version of code, making it difficult to use from the perspective of users.

We have not found any evidence of udp in the official libzt documentation, but we have found internal methods to provide the related UDP interfaces when compiling the source code. Therefore, this demo provides the corresponding usage methods on the Android terminal.

In addition, we have solved a series of problems when gradle compiling the Android AAR library in libzt, so users can download the source code and directly get the AAR library in the lib.

Of course, I would be very happy if you could leave your stars for me. ðŸ’• ðŸ’•
